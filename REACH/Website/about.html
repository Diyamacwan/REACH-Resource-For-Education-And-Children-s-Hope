                <h1>What Do We Do</h1>
                <p>Our platform allows students to create profiles, share their stories, and specify their funding needs. <br> Through REACH, donors can discover these stories and choose to contribute to the education and future of students who resonate with them. <br> We act as a bridge, ensuring that every donation goes directly to the intended recipient, fostering transparency and trust.</p>

                <h1>Our Values</h1>
                <p>We believe that education is a powerful tool that can change lives and transform communities. <br> Unfortunately, many students face financial barriers that hinder their ability to succeed. <br> We are driven by the belief that everyone deserves the opportunity to achieve their potential, and we are committed to making that a reality through our platform.</p>
